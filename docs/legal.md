## Disclaimer

* I have chosen some links to external pages as I think they contain useful information. But it may happen that some ninjas come and change the contents of the pages I link to or a proton hits the RAM of an NSA server and the link goes into a new direction or someone thinks you should not read what I liked once and then… What?
  **That&apos;s why I want to state that I am not responsible for the contents of the pages I link to.**
  And, just to say it: mostly, the pages I link to were made by people better than me. I often **WOULD NOT BE ABLE** to be responsible for what&apos;s stated there.
* The software is provided “AS IS”. If you do not like it, do not complain. You may contact me anyway, I would be very, very happy about that.
* The software did not hurt me, yet, and even worked as expected and there are even tests that prove it. Nonetheless, I cannot guarantee it will work as you expect.

**gresiblos** uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) together with the [material extension](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). I like mkdocs very much. The docs can be read online at [readthedocs](https://gresiblos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Thank you!

**gresiblos** is validated using Python's pytest and coverage libraries and the coverage is tracked on coveralls. Thank you!
