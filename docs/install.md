## Installing add-ons

__gresiblos__ currently supports two add-ons that are not part of the standard installation: **markdown**, and **degrotesque**.

```


## Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted programming language. For running __gresiblos__ and other scripts written in Python you have to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) itself, first.

For installing [Python](https://www.python.org/), use an installer for your system from <https://www.python.org>.

You should as well install **pip**, a package manager for python. After installing [Python](https://www.python.org/), you should be able to install **pip** using:

```console
python get-pip.py
```

You may upgrade pip using:

```console
pip install --upgrade pip
```
