# Entry Index

When run, __gresiblos__ builds a json file with some meta information about the processed entries. This file can be used for building a page that lists the entries, the topics, or other information, e.g. entries that address a specific topic.

## php Index Browser

A very simple (and probably very naive) php page for listing entries, topics, an topic entries is included and can be found at  [***&lt;GRESIBLOS&gt;*/tools/index.php**](https://github.com/dkrajzew/gresiblos/tree/main/tools/index.php).

## php RSS/Atom Feed Generator

A script that generates an RSS or an Atom feed using the index is given included and can be found at [***&lt;GRESIBLOS&gt;*/tools/feed.php**](https://github.com/dkrajzew/gresiblos/tree/main/tools/feed.php).
